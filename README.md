# VietFood
VietFood is an Android app that stores recipes for Vietnamese cuisine through the utilization of databases. Programmed in Java, the app was created to raise awareness about Vietnamese cuisine by providing minimalistic recipe instructions and allowing users to share their personal recipes.

## Creation Process
The application was designed to solve an issue from a client, who found it difficult to introduce her friends to Vietnamese cuisines as the recipes found online were often long and confusing. As such, the client requested I created an Android app, minimalistic in design, which includes simple recipe instructions.
